## Getting started with Salmon

This brief tutorial will explain how you can get started using Salmon to quantify your RNA-seq data.

### Obtaining Salmon

Salmon is a free (both as in "free beer" and "free speech") software tool for estimating transcript-level abundance from RNA-seq read data.  It is developed openly on GitHub.  You can visit Salmon's GitHub page [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon), and check out the Salmon source code, feature requests, known issues etc.  However, the easiest way to get started with Salmon is to download the pre-compiled binaries for your platfor from the [releases page](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases).  We provide binaries for both 64-bit Linux and MacOS.

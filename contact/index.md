The Salmon software is developed by [Rob Patro](http://www.robpatro.com) at
[Stony Brook University](http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu) in collaboration with
[Geet Duggal](http://www.geetduggal.com) and [Carl Kingsford](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf) at the [Computational Biology Department](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu), and [Mike Love](http://mikelove.github.io/) at [UNC Chapel Hill](http://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) and [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.github.io/) at [Harvard](http://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) and the [Dana Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org/).

We're very interested to hear others' feedback about using Salmon for their
projects and in their pipelines.  To this end, Salmon is actively developed on
GitHub and we interact regularly with users on our [Google Group](http://ongen.us/SForum).

Please report any bugs or feature requests via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues).

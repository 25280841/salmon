Overview
--------

Salmon is a tool for quantifying the expression of transcripts using RNA-seq
data. Salmon uses new algorithms (specifically, coupling the concept of
*quasi-mapping* with a two-phase inference procedure) to provide
accurate expression estimates very quickly (i.e. *wicked-fast*) and while using
little memory. Salmon performs its inference using an expressive and
realistic model of RNA-seq data that takes into account experimental attributes
and biases commonly observed in *real* RNA-seq data.
